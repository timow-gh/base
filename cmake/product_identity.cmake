# MSI upgrade code. Windows Installer uses it to recognize a new MSI as an upgrade
# of an installed earlier version of this product. It is not a secret: it is part
# of every MSI and of the registry of every machine the product is installed on.
#
# NEVER CHANGE IT after the first release. A different value turns the next MSI
# into a separate product that installs side by side with the old version instead
# of upgrading it. The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) compares it
# with the last release and refuses to publish a release in which it changed.
